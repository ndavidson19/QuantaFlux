# QuantaFlux: Real-time Stock Data Processing and Analysis

QuantaFlux is a robust, scalable system for real-time stock data processing and analysis. It leverages Apache Kafka for data streaming, implements various trading strategies, and provides a flexible architecture for future expansions.

## Architecture Overview

QuantaFlux consists of several key components:

1. Raw Data Producer: Fetches stock data from external sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
2. Processed Data Producer: Transforms raw data into a standardized format.
3. Strategy Producer: Applies trading strategies to the processed data.
4. Consumers: Multiple consumers for raw data, processed data, and strategy signals.

## Components

- `StockDataProducer`: Fetches raw stock data and publishes to Kafka.
- `ProcessedDataProducer`: Consumes raw data, processes it, and publishes to a new Kafka topic.
- `StrategyProducer`: Applies trading strategies to processed data and generates signals.
- `StockDataConsumer`: Generic consumer that can be configured for different Kafka topics.
- `MovingAverageCrossoverStrategy`: An example trading strategy implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Apache Kafka
- Gradle

### Building the Project

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Running the Application

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Configuration

The application uses several Kafka topics:

- `raw-stock-data`: Raw stock data from external sources.
- `processed-stock-data`: Standardized stock data.
- `[StrategyName]-signals`: Trading signals generated by each strategy.

Kafka bootstrap servers and other configurations can be adjusted in the respective classes.

## Adding New Strategies

To add a new trading strategy:

1. Implement the `TradingStrategy` interface.
2. Add the new strategy to the list in `App.java`.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated trading strategies.
- Add a user interface for real-time monitoring.
- Integrate with actual trading platforms for automated trading.
- Implement backtesting capabilities.
